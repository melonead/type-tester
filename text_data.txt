Life insurers have , a policy dividend reserve 
for mutual life insurance = companies that provide 
refunds for participating insurance policies 
on premiums paid during the year if the loss experience, 
operating expense and investment income of the insurer 
are better than expected at the beginning of the year. 
To maximize the probability that dividends can be paid 
regularly, premiums on participating policies are higher 
than premiums on nonparticipating policies that provide 
similar coverage but that are not entitled to dividends. 
Policy dividend accumulation are past dividends that 
policyholders have reinvested in interest-bearing accounts: dividend 
obligations payable are policy dividends declared during the current 
year but not yet paid to policyholders because policy dividends 
are considered refunds of previous payments they are 
taxable to the insured when paid.
